# rOpenSci Code of Conduct Reporting Form

To report on any potential violation of our Code of Conduct (https://ropensci.org/conduct/), please fill out this form to the best of your ability - one report per incident (per date/time/location). The results of this form, including the reporter's identity, are shared only with the rOpenSci Code of Conduct Committee: Mark Padgham (rOpenSci Software Research Scientist) and Megan Carter (independent community member). Kara Woo (independent community member) is on leave from the committee until May 2022 and will not receive reports during that time. 

You may also make a report directly to one member of the Committee by contacting them directly. If any member of the Committee has a conflict of interest with a report, they will be recused and will not have access to the content or process of the report followup.

Upon submitting your report, you will receive a copy of your responses via email. You should receive a separate acknowledgement of receipt via email from the Code of Conduct Committee within 24 hours on weekdays, or within 24 hours for an event that takes place on a weekend. Please email conduct@ropensci.org if you have not received this acknowledgement. The Committee will investigate your report and follow up according to our Code of Conduct with the aim of making a decision and implementing enforcement as soon as is reasonably possible.
